This is a servlet for converting SPOT feeds to KML feeds.

SPOT (http://www.findmespot.com/) is a service and a product line of gadgets
for GPS tracking.

KML (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) is Keyhole Markup
Language, the XML format used by Google Earth, Google Maps, and other GIS tools.

This servlet does a simple translation, converting the SPOT feed into a KML
document. The SPOT documentation at
http://faq.findmespot.com/index.php?action=showEntry&data=69 explains how to do
this with Yahoo! Pipes pipe and they have an existing pipe for this, but I
needed to do some other processing with the data, so I built this.

Once deployed, one supplies the SPOT "glId" as the parameter "SPOTID" to the
servlet. e.g.,:
http://localhost:8080/spot2kml/spot2kml?SPOTID=0XapxKiqW4RCHYhVkaCBpaHT3cNMUcEef
